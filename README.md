# Exploration and Communication Using Mobile Robots

This is an continuation of my Master Project.
It is based on the Neural Network simulator created by Elio Tuci(elt7@aber.ac.uk) and
Muhanad Hayder Mohammed(mhm1@aber.ac.uk).
This program is based on the E-Puck robot platform.

The aim of this project is to implement a variety of different neural networks and compare their performance in an
 exploration and communication task.
